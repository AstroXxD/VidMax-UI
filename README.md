# VidMax-UI
This is a movie, TV series, and video streaming platform. The service is available here under monthly and yearly subscriptions. This is available through a website. This includes content that people of all ages can view.

For this, I created a simple website. For this, I used a simple animation that changed the background image for the landing page. An unordered list was used for the navigation bar and posters of films were created for the Movies page. A table was used to show subscription plans.
I have created a signup form and a login form for this and if the username and password are blank in the login form, an alert will appear. A function was used from Javascript.
